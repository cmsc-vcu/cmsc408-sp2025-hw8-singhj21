# Exercises

In the following exercises, write the SQL as requested to discover the answer.

## Task 1

How many records are in the country table?

```{python}

# (skills: select, aggregate)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  count(*) as "Row Count"
from
  world_bank_data.wdi_country

```

## Task 2

Explore the first 5 records in the country table.

```{python}

```


## Task 3

List all non-countries.

```{python}
## task 3
## Which records are NOT for countries, that is they're for regions or groups of countries.
## How can you tell?
## Once you figure it out, write a query to list all the non-countries
## (skills: select, where)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
SELECT `Long Name` FROM world_bank_data.wdi_country
WHERE Region is NULL

## Task 4

Create your own copy of WDI_Country containing just countries.

```{python}

## using CREATE TABLE ... SELECT from WHERE syntax.
## Finally, below write a query to return the number
## of records in the new table.

```{python}
## Let's investigate the country_region field.
## What is the domain of the country_region field? That is,

## Task 13

```{python}

## Using CASE statements, DO IT!  BE SURE to include the countries without

## HINT - your query should return 6 columns: the region name, one
## column for each of the income categories (e.g., High, Upper middle, etc.)

## Task 18

# Reflection

1. Reflect on the SQL skills you used throughout these exercises. Which skills do you feel most confident in, and which do you think need more practice? How has this assignment helped you build or reinforce specific SQL competencies?

- In this assignment, I used a wide range of SQL skills, including basic commands like SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, and GROUP BY, as well as more advanced techniques such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), pivoting data using CASE WHEN statements, and performing data corrections with UPDATE. I feel most confident in using simple SELECT queries, filtering records with WHERE conditions, and aggregating results with GROUP BY and COUNT. These skills have become second nature through repeated practice in this assignment.

However, I realized I need more practice working with more complex joins and subqueries, especially when it comes to finding missing combinations (as in Task 18) or calculating dynamic percentages (as in Tasks 19 and 20). Crafting CTEs correctly and understanding how different temporary tables interact was initially challenging but became easier after experimenting with simple examples first.

Overall, this assignment reinforced my ability to think step-by-step when solving SQL problems. It also helped me learn how to write queries that are both functional and readable, which is critical when working on real-world datasets that can be very large and complex.

2. Problem-Solving Approach: Describe your approach to tackling the more complex tasks (like Tasks 18, 23, and 24). How did you break down these problems, and what steps did you take when you encountered challenges? How would you approach a similar problem differently in the future?

- For the more complex tasks, I found it essential to break the problems down into smaller, more manageable parts before attempting to write the final query. For example, in Task 18, I first separately identified the list of all distinct regions and the list of all income categories, and only then thought about how to create all possible combinations using a cross join. By tackling each part individually, I could test small queries one at a time and avoid overwhelming myself.

Whenever I encountered challenges, especially when queries became very nested or when error messages appeared, I would simplify the query back down to the basic elements to see where things were breaking. I also used online documentation and SQL syntax examples to guide me when I was unsure about the exact structure of CTEs or joins.

In the future, for complex queries, I would spend more time sketching out the logical steps and relationships on paper or in a flowchart before typing anything. Having a clear visual of what I want the query to achieve would save time and reduce confusion. I would also try to comment my code more heavily to keep track of each step inside longer queries.

3. Learning Takeaways: Consider the overall learning experience from this assignment. What were the biggest takeaways about working with SQL for data analysis and transformation? How do you think these skills will apply in real-world scenarios or future coursework?

- The biggest takeaway from this assignment is realizing how powerful SQL can be not just for retrieving data, but for completely reshaping and analyzing it. Before this assignment, I mostly thought of SQL as a way to run simple queries. Now, I understand that SQL can be used to build complex analytical workflows, perform percentage calculations, identify missing data, and generate fully pivoted, human-readable reports — all without needing a programming language like Python.

Another important learning point was appreciating how important data cleaning and validation are. Tasks like correcting inconsistent income categories and detecting missing region-income pairs showed me that good data analysis starts with making sure your dataset is clean and consistent.

In real-world scenarios, these skills will be essential for any data analyst, database developer, or even cybersecurity professional working with incident or event logs. I feel more prepared to work with large, messy datasets, think critically about data quality, and write queries that tell a clear story with the data. These skills will definitely help me in future coursework, internships, and professional projects that involve real-world databases.
